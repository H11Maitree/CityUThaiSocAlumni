### Support Thai culture at CityU
Your contribution helps current Thai students run **CityU-recognised** Thai cultural events without having to front large expenses.

## Summary

CityU Thai Alumni Society (In Formation) maintains a small **support reserve** used only for:

- **interest-free, repayable cash-flow support** for **reimbursable** event expenses.

Important: the Society **does not reimburse or sponsor** expenses as a grant. Any cash-flow support is expected to be **fully repaid** after the organiser receives the official reimbursement/funding credit.

## Pre-contribute now (during formation)

We are currently in the formation stage and do not yet have a Society bank account.

ThaiSoc is preparing its signature event **Thai Night 2026** (expected March). As a pilot arrangement, contributors may be asked to transfer funds either:

1) to the Society after formation (once an official account is ready), or  
2) directly to ThaiSoc strictly for the same **repayable cash-flow support** purpose.

To express interest in pre-contributing, contact:

With your consent, **contributors may be listed on our website as pre-contributors**.

## How your contribution is used

We provide cash-flow support only when the organiser already has:

- an official **CityU connection** (recognised/supervised/registered), and
- **written confirmation** that the relevant expenses are approved for **reimbursement/funding credit**.

The organiser uses the support to pay the approved costs, then repays the same amount once the reimbursement arrives.

## What your contribution is (and isn’t)

- It is a **member contribution**, not an investment.
- It is **not tax-deductible** (we are not a registered charity).
- It does **not** earn profit, interest, dividends, or any return.

## If the Society dissolves

If the Society dissolves, we will:

1. settle any outstanding liabilities; then  
2. **return the remaining uncommitted principal** to contributors **pro rata**, with **no profit or interest**; and  
3. transfer any **remaining balance** (including bank interest or unclaimable amounts after reasonable contact attempts) to **City University of Hong Kong** (or a CityU-designated fund), as set out in the Constitution.

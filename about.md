**CityU Thai Alumni Society** is an independent alumni-led group that supports Thai student–led Thai cultural events at City University of Hong Kong.

## Establishment status

The Society is currently **in formation** and preparing to register under the **Societies Ordinance (Cap. 151) of Hong Kong**.

Until registration is complete:

- our Constitution is in draft and will be proposed for formal adoption after registration; and
- internal controls are being set up to keep all activity funding transparent and accountable.

## What we do

We support **official CityU-connected events**—activities that are supervised, registered, or formally recognised by a CityU unit or an official CityU student organisation.

Our support is **cash-flow only**:

- We provide **interest-free, repayable cash-flow support** to help organisers pay approved event costs upfront **while waiting for reimbursement** from CityU.
- The Society **does not reimburse** expenses as a “grant” and **does not pay for expenses permanently**. The organiser repays the same amount to the Society after the official reimbursement is received.

## When we can support

We can support only when:

- the event is officially linked to CityU (recognised/supervised/registered by a CityU unit/office, hall, department, or ThaiSoc); and
- the organiser already has **written confirmation** that the relevant expense categories are **approved for reimbursement or funding credit**; and
- the cash-flow support is used only for **approved, reimbursable expense** items, based on written reimbursement/funding approval from CityU.

## Alumni contributions

Alumni can help by making **member contributions** to a shared support reserve. These contributions:

- keep the reserve sustainable (a “revolving” pool);
- are **not an investment** and do not earn any profit, interest, or benefit; and
- may be **refundable (principal only)** for any portion that remains uncommitted, subject to the Society’s commitments and internal rules.

On dissolution, remaining uncommitted principal may be returned **pro rata (no profit)**, with any remainder (including bank interest) transferred to **CityU**, as set out in the Constitution.

## Current initiative

We are preparing to support **Thai Night 2026** (hosted by the [Thai Students’ Association of CityU (ThaiSoc)](https://www.instagram.com/thaisoc.cityu)) as the Society’s first pilot activity, by providing **reimbursable event cash-flow** ahead of reimbursement timelines.

## Independence

CityU Thai Alumni Society is independent. It is not officially affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by City University of Hong Kong.

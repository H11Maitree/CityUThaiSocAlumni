### Are you hosting a Thai-related activity on the CityU campus?
### We may be able to provide temporary financial support.

## Summary
Current Thai students at City University of Hong Kong may request to borrow funds from the CityU Thai Alumni Society (In Formation) as short-term cash-flow support when organizing Thai cultural events that are officially approved by City University of Hong Kong (CityU).

## Eligibility
1. The proposed event or activity must be culturally related to Thailand.
2. The organizer(s) must be Thai full-time current student(s) at CityU at the time of the proposed event or activity.

   - [Student Residence Office](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/sro/) or its affiliated units (e.g. Halls)
   - [Thai Students’ Association of CityU (ThaiSoc)](https://www.instagram.com/thaisoc.cityu)
4. The proposed event and the requested loan amount must have received prior approval for reimbursement or funding credit from an organization other than the CityU Thai Alumni Society (In Formation).

## How to Request a Loan

#### Required Documentation

The following documents must be provided:

#### **Via the President of the Thai Students’ Association of CityU (ThaiSoc)**

_Given the existence of ThaiSoc, our priority is to support its signature events that represent Thailand as a whole. However, individual students with their own proposals may also request support through the President of ThaiSoc, subject to his or her approval._

_The ThaiSoc President will assess whether the request aligns with ThaiSoc’s financial plan and our limited available resources before forwarding it to us._

Please send the required documentation to the ThaiSoc President:

**Phuriyaphan**  
Email: 

The ThaiSoc President shall review and provide a decision within 14 days. If no decision is made within this period, the request may be submitted directly to us, on the assumption that there is no objection from ThaiSoc.

#### **Direct Submission** to us

A request may be submitted directly to the CityU Thai Alumni Society (In Formation) under the following circumstances:

- ThaiSoc is not in operation (e.g., dissolved), or
- The ThaiSoc President fails to provide a decision within 14 days.

**In such cases, please include dated evidence of prior contact with the ThaiSoc President (e.g., email correspondence).**

Please send the required documentation to the Acting Administrator:

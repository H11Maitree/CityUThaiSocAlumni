### Hosting a Thai-related activity at CityU?
We may be able to help with **cash-flow** for reimbursable costs.

## Summary

Current Thai students at City University of Hong Kong may request **interest-free, repayable cash-flow support** from CityU Thai Alumni Society (In Formation) for Thai cultural events that are:

- **officially connected to CityU** (supervised, registered, or recognised by a CityU unit / office / hall / department, or a recognised CityU student organisation such as ThaiSoc); and
- already approved for **reimbursement or funding credit** from CityU.

Important: we provide **cash-flow support only**. The Society **does not reimburse** expenses as a grant. The support amount must be repaid after the official reimbursement is received.

## Eligibility

1. The event/activity is Thai cultural in nature.
2. The organiser(s) are Thai full-time current CityU student(s) at the time of the event.
3. The event is **CityU-recognised**, e.g. registered/supervised by:
   - [Global Engagement Office](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/geo/)
   - [Student Residence Office](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/sro/) (including halls)
   - [Thai Students’ Association of CityU (ThaiSoc)](https://www.instagram.com/thaisoc.cityu)
   - or another official CityU unit/office.
4. You have **written confirmation** that the relevant expenses are approved for **reimbursement/funding credit** by CityU.
5. You agree to repay the support amount promptly once reimbursement is received.

## What to submit

Please provide:

- Event **proposal** (you may reuse the version submitted to CityU)
- Proof of approved **reimbursement/funding credit arrangement** from CityU (email or document)
- Requested amount
- Expected reimbursement timeline

## How to request support

### Option A — via ThaiSoc President

Because ThaiSoc represents Thai student activities as a whole, we prefer requests to go through ThaiSoc first when appropriate.

Send the documents above to the ThaiSoc President:

**Phuriyaphan**  
Email: (to be added)

ThaiSoc will aim to respond within **14 days**. If there is no decision within that period, you may submit directly to us (Option B).

### Option B — direct submission

You may submit directly if:

- ThaiSoc is not operating (e.g., dissolved), or
- no decision is given within 14 days.

Please include dated evidence of prior contact with ThaiSoc (e.g., email).

Send to the Acting Administrator:

**CityU Thai Alumni Society** is an independent alumni initiative formed to support Thai students at City University of Hong Kong. Our purpose is to strengthen connections between alumni and current students while fostering a sustainable and supportive Thai student community.

## Establishment Status

The Society will soon be in the process of formal establishment under the [**Societies Ordinance (Cap. 151) of Hong Kong**](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap151).

During this transitional period:

- The Constitution remains in draft form and is proposed for future formal adoption.
- Governance and operational procedures are being structured in preparation for official registration.

All current activities are conducted under this transitional framework.

## Objective

The objective of the Society is to provide temporary financial assistance to support student-led initiatives related to Thai culture and activities organized by current CityU students.

### Current (First) Initiative

At present, we are preparing to extend a loan to the [Thai Students’ Association of CityU (ThaiSoc)](https://www.instagram.com/thaisoc.cityu) for their upcoming March event, **Thai Night 2026**, to assist with event cash-flow prior to university reimbursement procedures.

## Independence

CityU Thai Alumni Society is an independent alumni initiative. It is not officially affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by City University of Hong Kong.

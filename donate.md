### Support Thai Culture Sharing at CityU!
### Your contribution strengthens sustainable student-led Thai cultural initiatives.

## Summary
Your donation supports the CityU Thai Alumni Society (In Formation) in providing short-term, repayable financial assistance to Thai students organizing culturally related events at City University of Hong Kong (CityU).

These funds are used strictly as temporary cash-flow support prior to official reimbursement from approved CityU units or other funding bodies. Borrowed amounts are expected to be fully returned once reimbursement has been received.

This revolving approach ensures that donations remain sustainable and can continue supporting future student initiatives.

## Pre-Donate Now!

The CityU Thai Alumni Society is currently in the formation stage and has not yet established an official bank account.

Meanwhile, the Thai Students’ Association of CityU (ThaiSoc) is proposing its signature event, **Thai Night 2026**, to be held this coming March. We are therefore seeking to connect early financial support with this event as a pilot initiative under our transitional arrangement.

We are currently accepting expressions of interest for pre-donation support. If you wish to participate, please contact one of our team members at your convenience:

**Donors may be listed on our website as pre-donors** (with consent). You will be notified when either:

1. The Society has completed its formation and is ready to formally receive donations; or  
2. ThaiSoc is ready to receive the temporary loan.

In the latter case, you may be asked to transfer funds directly to ThaiSoc. ThaiSoc will then return the borrowed amount to the Society once reimbursement has been received.

###  What's the benefit of having Thai cultural events/activities at CityU
1. **Promote Thai culture internationally**  
   Share Thailand’s cultural heritage with the wider CityU and global community.

2. **Support students in earning official recognition and participation credits**  
   Organizing officially recognized events may contribute to **Diversity Grants, Hall Points**, and participation records considered in the Student Residence Return Application process administered by CityU.

3. **Develop teamwork and leadership skills**  
   Students gain valuable experience in event planning, collaboration, and organizational management, strengthening their university experience and future career profiles.

4. **Strengthen community continuity**  
   Provide long-term stability for the [Thai Students’ Association of CityU (ThaiSoc)](https://www.instagram.com/thaisoc.cityu) and future generations of Thai students.

5. **Foster social connection**  
   Encourage engagement and connection among Thai students and the broader campus community.

### How Will My Donation Be Used?

Donations are pooled into a support reserve that provides short-term, repayable loans to eligible Thai student organizers.

**Funds are disbursed only when the event has received prior approval for reimbursement from an official unit or funding body.**

Returned **funds are recycled** to support future events.

### Why Is Cash-Flow Support Needed?

Although Thai student events are typically approved for reimbursement by CityU or other funding bodies, reimbursement often occurs several months after the event concludes.

Without temporary financial support, **students are required to advance personal funds and wait extended periods for reimbursement**. This creates unnecessary financial burden and may discourage participation.

The Society exists to reduce this burden by providing structured, short-term support.

### What Happens If the Society Ceases Operation?

CityU Thai Alumni Society (In Formation) is structured as a non-profit organization under the [Societies Ordinance (Cap. 151) of Hong Kong](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap151). **Donations are non-refundable and cannot be returned to donors.**

In the event that the Society ceases operation, **remaining funds will be transferred in accordance with the Society’s proposed Constitution**. The current proposal is for any remaining assets to be donated to [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/do/agc/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Donation-form.pdf) or another designated charitable recipient as specified in the finalized Constitution.

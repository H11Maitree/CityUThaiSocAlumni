This Constitution sets out how **CityU Thai Alumni Society** (the “Society”) operates as an independent, non-profit alumni association that provides **interest-free, repayable cash-flow support** for **CityU-recognised Thai cultural events** hosted by current CityU students.

> Note: This is a draft for internal governance.

## 1. Name

The name of the association is **CityU Thai Alumni Society**.

## 2. Status and purpose

1. The Society is a **non-profit** association formed by alumni to support current Thai students at City University of Hong Kong (“CityU”).
2. The Society is **independent** and is not officially affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by CityU.
3. The Society’s purposes are:
   - to strengthen connections between alumni and current students; and
   - to provide **cash-flow support** to organisers of **Supported Events** so they do not need to advance personal funds while waiting for official reimbursement/funding credit.

## 3. Non-profit and “cash-flow only”

1. The Society does not exist to generate profit for any person.
2. No part of the Society’s funds or property may be paid or transferred to any person **by way of profit, interest, dividend, or benefit**.
3. The Society provides **cash-flow support only**. The Society does not provide grants, sponsorships, or reimbursements as a permanent outflow. Any support disbursed is expected to be **repaid in full**.
4. Any cash-flow support provided under this Constitution:
   - is **interest-free**; and
   - is limited to **reimbursable, documented event expenses** for Supported Events.

## 4. Definitions

- **Alumni**: a person who has studied at CityU and is recognised as an alumnus/alumna.
- **Current Student**: a person currently enrolled at CityU.
- **Supported Event**: a Thai cultural event hosted by current students or a recognised student group and **officially connected to CityU** (e.g., held under CityU/student-organisation frameworks, or otherwise CityU-recognised).
- **Reimbursable Expense**: an expense category that is eligible for reimbursement (or funding credit) under the event’s confirmed reimbursement/funding arrangement from CityU, supported by appropriate documentation.
- **Contribution**: a voluntary payment by an alumnus to support the Society’s purposes (not a charitable donation and not an investment).
- **Contributing Member**: an alumni member who has made a Contribution (or an active contribution commitment recorded by the Society) within the past 24 months.

2. Voting rights:
   - Only **Contributing Members** may vote in elections and removal of officers.
3. Membership may be terminated for serious misconduct, misuse of funds, fraud, or behaviour that materially harms the Society, by a majority decision of the Committee (Section 7), subject to a right to be heard.

## 6. Contributions

1. Contributions are made to support the Society’s purposes. They:
   - are **not charitable donations** and are **not tax-deductible**; and
   - do not provide any profit, interest, dividend, or benefit in return.
2. Contributions may be earmarked for a specific Supported Event or a general event support reserve.

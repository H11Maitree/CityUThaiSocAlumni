Dear Thai Alumni of CityU,

We are excited to share the very first initiative of the **CityU Thai Alumni Society (In Formation)** — and we would love your support.

Thai Students’ Association of CityU (ThaiSoc) is preparing for its signature cultural event, **Thai Night 2026**, this coming March. As many of us remember, organizing a major cultural event often requires students to advance their own funds while waiting months for official reimbursement from CityU.

That is exactly the gap we aim to solve.

We are inviting expressions of interest for **pre-donation support** as part of our pilot initiative to provide structured, short-term cash-flow assistance for Thai Night 2026.

### 💡 How It Works

- Your contribution will be used strictly as short-term, repayable cash-flow support.
- Once ThaiSoc receives official reimbursement, the borrowed amount will be returned.
- During our formation stage, no transfers will be arranged without prior confirmation with you.

This revolving approach allows the same support to benefit future generations of Thai students.

### 🌏 Why This Matters

Without structured support, students often need to advance personal funds and wait several months for reimbursement. Your participation helps:

- Reduce financial burden on current students  
- Sustain Thai cultural representation at CityU  
- Strengthen the continuity of our Thai community  

Even a small commitment can make a meaningful difference.

If you are interested in participating as a pre-donor, please visit our [Donate page]({{ site.baseurl }}/donate) or contact one of our team members listed there.

Thank you for helping us build something sustainable for the next generation of Thai students at CityU.

More updates will follow as we complete our formation process under the Societies Ordinance (Cap. 151) of Hong Kong.

**Maitree**,

Acting Admin

Dear ThaiSoc Cabinet 25/26,

Last week I revisited the idea of an **alumni cash-flow support** reserve with the current ThaiSoc President, **Phraewa**. I’m glad this will be discussed in this Friday’s meeting alongside the **Thai Night 2026** proposal.

This isn’t the first time I raised this. During the Thai Night 2025 proposal meeting under **Marisa’s** cabinet, I briefly pointed out an ongoing issue: ThaiSoc cabinets often end up **advancing personal money** to run events that are reimbursable later. Over time, ThaiSoc has improved—especially in the past two years—by checking financial capability more carefully before proposing events. That progress matters. But the core burden still exists and keeps getting passed down generation to generation.

I said last year that once I became alumni, I would try to build a better system. Now I am doing it—**not for any one cabinet**, but to start a long-term alumni involvement culture that reduces financial stress for current students.

I’ve already received several **pre-contribution commitments** from alumni, and former ThaiSoc President **Jeeraphat** has also expressed support. Alumni understand this stress because we lived it. **If ThaiSoc is open to endorsing this idea, I believe more alumni will be willing to contribute**—and more will be happy to come back and visit ThaiSoc events on campus.

I also understand a concern raised in my conversation with Phraewa: the Thai student population at CityU may be decreasing, and some people worry ThaiSoc might not last beyond this year. I want to be clear: **the future of ThaiSoc belongs to the juniors**, not to alumni or current seniors predicting outcomes. To address practical concerns, I designed this support reserve to be **refundable to contributors (principal only)** if it isn’t useful—either by request or **automatically after five years** of no support activity.

**Whether the population of Thai student in CityU will becomes bigger or smaller isn’t the main point. What matters is that Thai students—now and in the future—still have an opportunity to organise Thai cultural events at CityU like we have**, and that alumni can support them in a healthy, sustainable way. I hope we avoid spreading **“ThaiSoc will dissolve”** narratives (true or not) that might discourage juniors before they even step up. With alumni cash-flow support, I believe it becomes easier and more enjoyable for new generations to take leadership. I’ve also heard other small-population communities can still sustain an association (e.g., CityU Myanmar Society), which is encouraging.

Even if ThaiSoc were to dissolve in the future, this alumni support model can still help individual Thai students run **CityU-recognised** hall events or other Thai-related activities—by providing **interest-free, repayable cash-flow support** once the event has **written reimbursement/funding approval** from an official CityU unit.

Finally, this is **“now or never”** for me. As alumni, we naturally become more distant from new cohorts over time. Starting this while I still know many of you personally is the most realistic way to build trust and set the foundation. If it doesn’t work out, I still hope it plants a seed—so that when you become alumni, you can continue it or build something even better.

We learn something new from ThaiSoc every year. I hope we—and future generations—continue learning from it.

#### P.S. What ThaiSoc taught me

- **Year 1:** Reimbursement takes time. I paid for a Pad Thai tray and waited a long time to be reimbursed.  
- **Year 2:** When cash-flow isn’t stressful, Thai Night is genuinely fun.  
- **Year 3:** Don’t propose before assessing our own cash position—some cabinets suffered for it.  
- **Year 4:** Don’t expect Thai Night to be perfect; expect it to be fun. When perfection becomes the goal, ThaiSoc can feel like a battlefield.  

**Maitree**
